    "FewShotQuestion": "How many weights are in the max pooling operation of the image $X$ above with a 2x2 kernel, with stride of 2, and padding with a value of 1, 1 pixel on the right side and bottom of the image.0.  Max pooling layers don't have learnable parameters.\n\nDetermine how many pixels of padding we need on the input of size 80 by 80 to ensure our filter 31 by 31 gives an output of the same size.15. For an image of size $(x, x)$, a padding of size $a$, and a filter of size $(y, y)$ with default stride size of $1$, the output size is $((x+2a) - y)/1 + 1$.  In this case, we have $\\frac{(x+2a) - y}{1} + 1 = x$ where $x=80$ and $y=31$.  Solving for $a$, we get $a=15$.\n\nConsider one layer of weights in a convolutional neural network processing grayscale images, connecting one layer of units to the next layer of units.
