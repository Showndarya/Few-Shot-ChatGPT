    "ChatGPTSolution": "a) They are trained using backpropagation.\nc) They are trained using supervised learning.\n\nConvolutional neural networks (ConvNets or CNNs) are a type of deep neural network commonly used for image analysis tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. ConvNets are typically trained using supervised learning, where a labeled dataset is used to train the network to perform a specific task. During training, the network uses backpropagation to adjust the weights of the filters in the convolutional layers to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual output. The optimization process is typically performed using gradient descent algorithms, which help the network to converge to a solution.",

CNNs have generally less parameters than fully-connected networks with the same number of layers and neurons, which is why CNNs are more efficient.  Also, any neural network can be trained to perform unsupervised learning tasks --- at least in principle.\n\nWhich of the following are true of pooling layers in CNNs?\n\\begin{enumerate}[label=\\alph*.]\n    \\item They reduce the size of the input to the next layer. \n    \\item They increase the number of parameters.\n    \\item They reduce the number of connections to the next layer. \n    \\item They reduce the number of parameters.\n\\end{enumerate}a, c, d. \\, b is false because pooling neither adds to nor subtracts from parameters.\n\nWhich of the following is true of the weights in a recurrent neural network?\n\\begin{enumerate}[label=\\alph*.]\n    \\item[a.] The weights are shared between all time steps.\n    \\item[b.] The weights are different for each time step.\n    \\item[c.] The weights are different for each input.\n    \\item[d.] The weights are different for each output.\n\\end{enumerate}a.\n\nWhich of the following are true of convolutional neural networks for image analysis? \n\\begin{enumerate}[label=\\alph*.]\n    \\item They are trained using backpropagation. \n    \\item They are trained using gradient descent.\n    \\item They are trained using supervised learning . \n    \\item They are trained using unsupervised learning.\n\\end{enumerate}",
