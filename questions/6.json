    "Question": "What is the result of performing average pooling on the image $X$?% = [[1, 17, 43, 4, 5], [2, 2, 6, 8, 7], [12, 9, 4, 46, 5], [3, 4, 78, 9, 62],[12, 11, 14, 42, 15] \n\n$$X = \\left(\\begin{matrix}\n1 & 17 & 43 & 4 & 5\\\\\n2 & 2 & 6 & 8 & 7\\\\\n12 & 9 & 4 & 46 & 5\\\\\n3 & 4 & 78 & 9 & 62\\\\\n12 & 11 & 14 & 42 & 15\n\\end{matrix}\\right)$$\n\n\nwith a $2\\times2$ kernel, with stride of 2, and padding with values of (1, 1) pixel on the right side and bottom of the image.",
    "Solution": "[[5.5, 15.25, 3.5], [7, 34.25, 17.25], [6.25, 14.5, 4.5]].  Note that the padded image is X' = [[1, 17, 43, 4, 5, 1], [2, 2, 6, 8, 7, 1], [12, 9, 4, 46, 5, 1], [3, 4, 78, 9, 62, 1],[12, 11, 14, 42, 15, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]], and the value of each pixel is the sum of the four values of the kernel divided by $4$.",
    "ChatGPTSolution": "In average pooling, the input image is divided into non-overlapping windows, and the average value of the elements within each window is computed to produce the corresponding element in the output feature map.\n\nFor the given image, with a $2\\times2$ kernel and stride of 2, the result of performing average pooling on the image would be:\n\n[2\n+\n2\n+\n12\n+\n9\n4\n43\n+\n6\n+\n4\n+\n78\n4\n12\n+\n11\n+\n3\n+\n4\n4\n42\n+\n8\n+\n9\n+\n62\n4\n]\n=\n[\n7\n24\n8\n33\n]\n[ \n4\n2+2+12+9\n\u200b\n \n4\n12+11+3+4\n\u200b\n \n\u200b\n  \n4\n43+6+4+78\n\u200b\n \n4\n42+8+9+62\n\u200b\n \n\u200b\n ]=[ \n7\n8\n\u200b\n  \n24\n33\n\u200b\n ]\nNote that padding with values of (1, 1) pixel on the right side and bottom of the image would increase the size of the image, but it does not affect the result of average pooling operation.",
