    "FewShotQuestion": "Which of the following are true of convolutional neural networks for image analysis?\n\\begin{enumerate}[label=\\alph*.]\n    \\item[a.] Filters in earlier layers tend to include edge detectors. \n    \\item[b.] Pooling layers reduce the spatial resolution of the image.\n    \\item[c.] They have more parameters than fully-connected networks with the same number of layers and the same number of neurons in each layer.\n    \\item[d.] A CNN can be trained for unsupervised learning tasks, whereas an ordinary neural net cannot. \n\\end{enumerate}a, b.  CNNs have generally less parameters than fully-connected networks with the same number of layers and neurons, which is why CNNs are more efficient.  Also, any neural network can be trained to perform unsupervised learning tasks --- at least in principle.\n\nConsider one layer of weights in a convolutional neural network processing grayscale images, connecting one layer of units to the next layer of units. Which of the following types of layers has the least parameters?\n\\begin{enumerate}[label=\\alph*.]\n    \\item[a.] A fully-connected layer from 20 hidden units to 4 output units. \n    \\item[b.] A convolutional layer with eight 5 $\\times$ 5 filters. \n    \\item[c.] A max-pooling layer that reduces a 10 $\\times$ 10 image to a 5 $\\times$ 5. \n    \\item[d.] A convolutional layer with ten 3 $\\times$ 3 filters. \n\\end{enumerate}c, because fully-connected layers and convolutional layers with filters have learnable parameters but pooling layers don't.\n\nDescribe the advantages of the Transformer architecture over CNNs and RNNs.The Transformer architecture utilizes an attention mechanism that allows it to learn the context of a given sequence, allowing it to better understand the input sequence. This attention mechanism allows the Transformer architecture to better capture long-term dependencies which are difficult to capture with CNNs and RNNs. Unlike RNNs, the Transformer architecture can process multiple parts of a sequence in parallel, allowing it to process data faster and more efficiently.\n\nSelect the best type of model for each use case, matching the use case to the options provided:\n\n\\noindent\nUse cases:\n\\begin{enumerate}[label=\\alph*.]\n    \\item[1.]\n    Tumor segmentation analysis or recognizing tumor patches in medical ``slides''.\n    \\item[2.]\n    Sentiment analysis on a large text corpus.\n    \\item[3.]\n    Time series forecasting to predict price of automobile in the next month.\n    \\item[4.]\n    Predict the price of a house based on square feet, ratio of bedrooms/bathrooms.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\noindent\nOptions: CNN, RNN, Fully connected neural network",
