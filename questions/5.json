    "Question": "For the flattened image represented by the vector x = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1] and filter k = [-1, 1, -1] what is the convolution of k with x with stride 1 and no padding?",
    "Solution": "[-2, 1, -1, 0, 0, -1, 0, -1].  Simply apply the rules of 1D convolution.",
    "ChatGPTSolution": "The convolution of filter $k$ with image $x$ can be calculated as follows:\n\nThe convolution starts by placing the filter $k$ at the first position of the image $x$.\n\nElement-wise multiplication is performed between the values in the filter and the values in the overlapping part of the image.\n\nThe values obtained from the multiplication are summed up, which gives us the value of the output feature map at the corresponding position.\n\nThe filter is then shifted one step to the right, and the process is repeated until the filter has covered all the positions in the image.\n\nFor example, for the first position in the output feature map, the calculation would be:\n\n$(-1 * 1) + (1 * 0) + (-1 * 1) = -2$\n\nFor the second position, the calculation would be:\n\n$(-1 * 0) + (1 * 1) + (-1 * 0) = 1$\n\nAnd so on. The final output feature map would be a 1-D vector with the same length as the number of steps taken by the filter, which in this case would be:\n\n$[-2, 1, -2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0]$",

    "FewShotQuestion": "How many weights are in the max pooling operation of the image $X$ above with a 2x2 kernel, with stride of 2, and padding with a value of 1, 1 pixel on the right side and bottom of the image.0.  Max pooling layers don't have learnable parameters.Determine how many pixels of padding we need on the input of size 80 by 80 to ensure our filter 31 by 31 gives an output of the same size.15. For an image of size $(x, x)$, a padding of size $a$, and a filter of size $(y, y)$ with default stride size of $1$, the output size is $((x+2a) - y)/1 + 1$.  In this case, we have $\\frac{(x+2a) - y}{1} + 1 = x$ where $x=80$ and $y=31$.  Solving for $a$, we get $a=15$.Which of the following is the correct filter for detecting horizontal edges?\n\\begin{enumerate}[label=\\alph*.]\n    \\item[a.]\n$$\\left(\\begin{matrix}\n1 & 0 & -1\\\\\n1 & 0 & -1\\\\\n1 & 0 & -1\n\\end{matrix}\\right)$$\n    \n    \\item[b.]\n$$\\left(\\begin{matrix}\n1 & 1 & 1\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n-1 & -1 & -1\n\\end{matrix}\\right)$$\n\n    \\item[c.]\n$$\\left(\\begin{matrix}\n1 & -1 & 1\\\\\n0 & -1 & 0\\\\\n1 & -1 & 1\n\\end{matrix}\\right)$$\n\n    \\item[d.]\n$$\\left(\\begin{matrix}\n1 & -1 & -1\\\\\n1 & 1 & -1\\\\\n1 & 0 & -1\n\\end{matrix}\\right)$$\n\\end{enumerate}b.
