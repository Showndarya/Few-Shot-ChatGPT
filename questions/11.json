For example, the first entry in the output matrix would be obtained by multiplying the entries in the top-left corner of the kernel with the entries in the corresponding position of the image, and summing the result:\n$$\\left(\\begin{matrix}\n1 & 1\\\\\n2 & 2\n\\end{matrix}\\right) \\times \\left(\\begin{matrix}\n1 & 2\\\\\n3 & 4\n\\end{matrix}\\right) = 1 \\times 1 + 1 \\times 2 + 2 \\times 3 + 2 \\times 4 = 14$$\nThe process would be repeated for every position in the output matrix.",

    "FewShotQuestion": "How many weights are in the max pooling operation of the image $X$ above with a 2x2 kernel, with stride of 2, and padding with a value of 1, 1 pixel on the right side and bottom of the image.0.  Max pooling layers don't have learnable parameters.\n\nDetermine how many pixels of padding we need on the input of size 80 by 80 to ensure our filter 31 by 31 gives an output of the same size.15. For an image of size $(x, x)$, a padding of size $a$, and a filter of size $(y, y)$ with default stride size of $1$, the output size is $((x+2a) - y)/1 + 1$.  In this case, we have $\\frac{(x+2a) - y}{1} + 1 = x$ where $x=80$ and $y=31$.  Solving for $a$, we get $a=15$.\n\nWhat is the output $s_3$ of the following RNN?\n\\begin{equation*}\n        x_1 = 1, x_2 = 1, x_3 = 1, w = 1, u = 1, v = 1, s_0 = 0\\\\\n\\end{equation*}\n\\begin{equation*}\n        s_1 = w \\cdot s_0 + x_1\n\\end{equation*}\n\\begin{equation*}\n        v_1 = s_1\n\\end{equation*}\n\\begin{equation*}\n        s_2 = w \\cdot s_1 + x_2\n\\end{equation*}\n\\begin{equation*}\n        v_2 = s_2\n\\end{equation*}\n\\begin{equation*}\n        s_3 = w \\cdot s_2 + x_3 = \\,\\, \\mathbf{?}\n\\end{equation*}3\n\nGiven an input image $X$, and the kernel $K$, with a stride of 1, and a zero padding of 1 pixel around the image.
