    "Solution": "b.",
    "ChatGPTSolution": "The correct answer is b. The sequence $1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, ?$ can be correctly predicted by a model using only the previous character.\n\nThis type of sequence, with alternating values of $1$ and $-1$, has a clear pattern that can be learned by the model. By using the previous character as input, the model can predict the next character in the sequence by simply alternating between $1$ and $-1$.\n\nFor the other sequences, the pattern is not as clear and additional information beyond just the previous character may be required to make accurate predictions.",
