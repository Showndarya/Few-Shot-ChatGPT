    "ChatGPTSolution": "We can find the weight $w$ using the given information. Let $s_0$ be the initial state, then we have:\n\n\\begin{equation*}\ns_1 = w \\cdot s_0 + x_1 = w \\cdot s_0 + 1\n\\end{equation*}\n\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_1 = s_1 = w \\cdot s_0 + 1\n\\end{equation*}\n\n\\begin{equation*}\ns_2 = w \\cdot s_1 + x_2 = w \\cdot (w \\cdot s_0 + 1) + 1 = w^2 \\cdot s_0 + w + 1\n\\end{equation*}\n\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_2 = s_2 = w^2 \\cdot s_0 + w + 1\n\\end{equation*}\n\n\\begin{equation*}\ns_3 = w \\cdot s_2 + x_3 = w \\cdot (w^2 \\cdot s_0 + w + 1) + 1 = w^3 \\cdot s_0 + w^2 + w + 1\n\\end{equation*}\n\n\\begin{equation*}\nv_3 = s_3 = w^3 \\cdot s_0 + w^2 + w + 1\n\\end{equation*}\n\nWe are given that $v_1 = 1$, $v_2 = 2$, and $v_3 = 3$, so we can use these equations to solve for $w$:\n\n\\begin{equation*}\n1 = w \\cdot s_0 + 1\n\\end{equation*}\n\n\\begin{equation*}\n2 = w^2 \\cdot s_0 + w + 1\n\\end{equation*}\n\n\\begin{equation*}\n3 = w^3 \\cdot s_0 + w^2 + w + 1\n\\end{equation*}\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we can find $w = 2$. This means that the weight $w$ is equal to 2.",
