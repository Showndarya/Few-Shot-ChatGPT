    "ChatGPTSolution": "The correct answer is b. It is a more general form of the GRU cell.\n\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture that are designed to address the issue of vanishing gradients in traditional RNNs. The LSTM cell has several gates that control the flow of information into and out of the cell state, allowing it to preserve information from the past for longer periods of time.\n\nThe Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is a simplified version of the LSTM cell that combines the forget and input gates into a single update gate, making it a less complex architecture. However, the LSTM cell provides more opportunities for control over the flow of information, making it a more general form of the GRU cell.",
